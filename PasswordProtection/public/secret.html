    <h1>Secrets</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Success doesn't come from what you do occasionally, it comes from what
        you do consistently. Make small steps daily towards your goals.
      </li>
      <li>
        The only limit to your impact is your imagination and commitment. Dream
        big and stay dedicated to your vision.
      </li>
      <li>
        Embrace challenges; they are opportunities in disguise. Each hurdle you
        overcome builds your strength and resilience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something
        inside you that is greater than any obstacle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can. Perfection is
        not necessary to begin, just take the first step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Surround yourself with positive people who believe in your dreams,
        encourage your ideas, support your ambitions, and bring out the best in
        you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going. Time is on your side
        when you persist and stay focused.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your life is your story, and the adventure ahead of you is the journey
        to fulfill your own purpose and potential.
      </li>
    </ul>
